            <h2>My Soccer Journey</h2>
            <p>I have been playing soccer since I was about 4 or 5 years old, and it is the favorite sport of us Brazilians. I enjoy playing futsal (indoor soccer) and also on the field. In 2019, I played in a high school while studying in the USA.</p>
            <h2>Why Soccer is My Favorite Sport</h2>
            <p>I play soccer every week with my friends, and I am considering joining a team here in Vancouver.</p>
